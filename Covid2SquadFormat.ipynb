Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don't know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods.

Many people infected with the COVID-19 virus \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec perhaps up to 25 percent \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec wouldn't even know they are ejecting virus-laden droplets, as they may not exhibit symptoms.\\n\\nDroplets suspended in the air are called an aerosol. Droplets that are large can remain in the air for seconds to minutes before falling to the ground. Smaller droplets stay in the air longer \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec minutes to even hours. It is important to note, however, that unless you are physically near an infected person, or in an indoor space with inadequate ventilation, COVID-19 virus in the air is unlikely to be a risk, because it is not likely to be present at a high enough level in the air to cause an infection to those who are far away.\\n\\nWe should all be minimizing the amount of time we spend in any one place, especially if others are nearby. This limits the time a person is potentially exposed to the virus.\\n\\nIt is also very important to stay as far away from one another as possible, minimum 6 feet. The farther, the better. Some experts recommend staying at least 25 feet away from others, even when outdoors. And it's a good idea to avoid crowded indoor spaces.\\n\\nThe traditional definition of airborne transmission is that small droplets containing a pathogen remaining viable over long time periods travel long distances in the air and infect other people when the pathogen is breathed in. Measles and tuberculosis are examples of respiratory diseases that remain infectious in the air for long time periods. The measles virus can live for up to two hours in the air where an infected person coughs or sneezes. Tuberculosis can live in the air for up to six hours.\\n\\nUnder experimental conditions, researchers found that the COVID-19 virus stayed viable in the air for three hours. The researchers estimate that in most real-world situations, the virus would remain suspended in the air for about 30 minutes, before settling onto surfaces. This is similar to what was found for SARS and MERS, which some researchers consider likely to be spread via airborne transmission. One study estimates that a person infected with the COVID-19 virus who speaks loudly for one minute produces at least 1,000 virus-containing droplets that remain airborne for more than 8 minutes. Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend airborne precautions for the care of COVID-19 suspected or confirmed patients.\\n\\nMany unknowns remain about the COVID-19 virus, such as how many virus particles need to be breathed in for an infection to begin. However, it is likely that active COVID-19 virus travels through the air when ejected by infected people. By staying as far away from one another as possible, keeping on the move, avoiding touching our faces, frequently washing our hands well with soap and water, coughing or sneezing into the crook of our elbows, wearing cloth face coverings (masks), and staying home when sick, we can protect ourselves and others.\"\n",

These models predict that aggressive suppression measures, such as isolation of infected people and their family members, and physical distancing of the entire population, including potential business and school closures, will need to be maintained until a vaccine is developed. Even if these measures are effective in reducing the spread of the virus, transmission of it is likely to increase as soon as the suppression measures are relaxed. The Imperial College study indicates that it may be possible to periodically relax the suppression measures, but that they will then need to be re-introduced as cases of infection begin to rise again. This cycle would continue until a vaccine is available. However, research is still ongoing, and many open questions remain about how the pandemic will evolve over time. We will gain new insights, for example, as countries that used suppression measures during the height of their outbreaks (such as China) begin to relax those measures, and we see whether the suppression is effective longer-term, or if cases begin to rebound more quickly.\\n\"\n",

Despite the number of cases falling, the virus is still circulating. Many of those who have tested positive for COVID-19 have not exhibited any symptoms. The best way to stop its spread and prevent the resurgence we've seen in other states that have reopened their economies is through robust testing and contact tracing.\\n\\nNew Jersey recently passed the 1 million mark in diagnostic tests performed in the state. We need to continue this trend to slow the transmission of the virus. Testing is vital to identify positive cases quickly, trace contacts and encourage them to get tested, self-isolate and monitor for symptoms.\\n\\nSince the pandemic began, the Murphy Administration has worked aggressively to ramp up testing. Today, testing is available for all residents who want it or need it. There are more than 250 testing sites.\\n\\nAs the outbreak spread, it further exposed and underscored long-standing health and economic inequalities in our nation and state. Residents of communities of color have been disproportionately impacted due to barriers in health care and testing, as well as having a higher prevalence of underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for serious complications and death.\\n\\nTo help reach underserved populations and urban areas, we are working to offer greater access to testing through mobile and walk-up sites in partnership with local public health departments, community and faith leaders, and the private sector.\\n\\nIt's especially important to get tested if you:\\n\\nAre experiencing symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, sore throat, muscle pain, shivering, headache, or new loss of taste or smell.\\nHave been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19\\nAre an essential worker (health care professional, transit worker, first responder or food service worker).\\nYou have participated in a large gathering\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00eelike a demonstration or march \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00eewhere you may not have been able to maintain social distancing.\\n\\nAlong with testing, it is also important to track the virus once someone tests positive.\\n\\nNew Jersey's local and county health departments are at the center of our contact tracing efforts, with some 800 contact tracers already on the job. To boost their ranks, the state is working with the Rutgers School of Public Health to develop a contact tracing curriculum that will help us to recruit, train and deploy 1,600 additional tracers by the end of June.\\n\\nContact tracers will only call if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or because you may have come in close contact with someone else who did. It's critical that you answer the call and provide important information that will help you and help to prevent further disease transmission in your community.\\n\\nTrained contact tracers will provide information on how you can protect those around you from getting sick, such as isolating yourself. They will tell you about available community supports such as job protection measures, pandemic unemployment benefits, child care resources and food assistance through NJ SNAP and WIC. If necessary, they will be able to link you to services to support you during your self-isolation period.\\n\\nAny information collected through contact tracing will be kept confidential. The contact tracer will not reveal your name or COVID-19 status to your contacts \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec that information will only be provided to public health officials. They will never ask for your social security number, financial information or immigration status. Your cell phone or GPS location won't be tracked, and the confidential information you provide will never be shared with immigration or law enforcement.\\n\\nNew Jersey is a very diverse state. We are working to ensure that as many of these new contact tracers as possible come from and reflect the diversity of the communities they will be working in. We expect that they will be able to effectively communicate and engage with individuals who speak other languages and have diverse cultures.\\n\\nIn order to be successful, we need to ensure residents are familiar with and trust the process. We have been reaching out to public health officers, community and interfaith leaders and elected officials so they educate their residents on these public health tools.\\n\\nThese efforts will help us build a stronger and safer New Jersey, and for us to be successful, we are counting on everyone to participate and cooperate.\\n\\nDo your part: Get tested to ensure your health and safety and that of your loved ones. And if a contact tracer telephones you, take the call. You can save a life.\\n\\nVisit COVID19.nj.gov/testing to find a site or talk to your doctor, local pharmacist or community health clinic.

Paul Sarlo in the Senate and Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin and Assemblyman John McKeon in the Assembly.\\n\\n\\\"This will give us the ability to provide the resources needed to respond to crisis economic conditions resulting from the coronavirus,\\\" said Senate President Steve Sweeney. \\\"It also includes a process to ensure responsibility in managing public finances as we work through the fiscal problems that are not fully known. We want to be responsive to financial needs, but we also have to be fiscally responsible and recognize the long-term consequences of actions we take.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We must keep New Jersey's economy moving and we have to continue to provide the government services that are so important during the pandemic,\\\" said Senator Paul Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee. \\\"While we understand the need for emergent financing to help with the economic recovery, we still have to be responsible with added debt. This is uncharted territory so we have to monitor fiscal conditions as we make decisions on borrowing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a devastating impact on the State's economy. Residents, businesses, and government units have seen significant adverse effects,\\\" said Assemblywoman Pintor Marin. \\\"The 'New Jersey COVID-19 Emergency Bond Act' authorizes the state to issue state general obligation bonds to help address the fiscal crisis caused by this pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 on our economy, budget and finances is unpredictable and changing rapidly. We must take action to ensure our fiscal viability by empowering the state to apply for and receive federal stimulus loans for the benefit of the state's ability to respond to the negative impacts of the coronavirus. We do not make this decision lightly. The historic nature of the current pandemic has led to this unprecedented last resort due to the current fiscal crisis.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The current public health crisis has thrust us into a new reality that is nothing short of profound and unprecedented,\\\" said Assemblyman McKeon. \\\"Especially when it comes to the toll it is taking on our state revenues and budget. The COVID-19 Emergency Bond Act, approved in the Legislature today, puts us a crucial step closer to crafting a fair and responsible path forward for all New Jersey residents come September. It's been said before and I'll say it again: we are in no position to cut or tax our way out the budget deficit we face, we must have the ability to borrow. This Act will enable the State to leverage funds quickly, so we can help everyday New Jerseyans during this once-in-a-lifetime pandemic.\\\"\"\n",

The Small Business Lease - Emergency Assistance Grant Program (SBL-EAGP) will allow businesses in 64 eligible municipalities to apply for grants of up to $10,000 for lease costs. The program will assist small business owners impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also assists landlords, many of whom are also small businesses.\\n\\n\\\"We are committed to helping small businesses across our state survive this unprecedented crisis,\\\" said Governor Murphy. \\\"A stronger and fairer New Jersey starts from the bottom up. The Small Business Lease - Emergency Assistance Grant Program will infuse much needed funding into local economies by assisting both small businesses and the landlords that they rent from.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Small Business Lease Emergency Grant Assistance Program is directly geared toward keeping the mom-and-pop shops on main streets and business centers afloat in this time of need, specifically in our most vulnerable communities in New Jersey,\\\" said Lt. Governor Sheila Oliver, who serves as Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs and Board Chair of the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority. \\\"Governor Murphy and I remain as committed as ever to supporting New Jersey's small businesses and this new lease program will work hand-in-hand with other state assistance programs to help them emerge from this crisis stronger.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am enormously proud to stand with Governor Murphy today to announce the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority Small Business Lease Emergency Assistance Grant Program. At NJRA, impact is and has always been our primary objective. And our number one priority is our state's most vulnerable communities and neighborhoods. Not only do we invest in the communities that need it the most, but we're there first in the areas that are often overlooked by traditional lenders. Right now New Jersey's small and micro businesses, particularly those in economically challenged communities, are bearing the brunt of our nation's health and economic crisis. These businesses deliver value and stability to our state, and yet, struggle to access capital. Today, we're proud to be there with the Governor to offer these businesses both rental relief grants and support accessing them,\\\" explained Leslie Anderson, President and CEO of the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority.\\n\\nThe SBL-EAGP, managed by the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority (NJRA), is the first component of a broader Main Street Commercial Corridors Relief Package to be paid for with federal CARES Act funding. Through the SBL-EAGP, small businesses located in NJRA's 64 eligible municipalities that have been adversely impacted by COVID-19 will be able to apply for up to $10,000 to assist with lease payments. It will provide grants to:\\n\\nTenants leasing commercial space in mixed-use buildings\\nTenants leasing space in commercial buildings\\nTenants leasing space to operate a storefront business\\n\\nThe program will be targeted to businesses with 5,000 square feet of leased space or less, and is requiring standard debarment and legal qualifications from applying businesses. Applications will open August 10, 2020, online, and funds will be distributed on a first come first served basis. $6 million in federal CARES Act funding will be allocated for this program.\\n\\\"Small business owners have been struggling to make ends meet throughout this pandemic\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00eeespecially when it comes to fixed costs like rent and utilities,\\\" said Senator Vin Gopal. \\\"Without additional aid, thousands of these businesses will go under permanently. These commercial rental assistance grants will go a long way toward helping small businesses and Mom-and-Pop stores survive.\\\"\\n\\\"I'm grateful to the Governor for working to make these federal CARES Act funds available to our hard-working and struggling small businesses,\\\" said Assemblywoman Joann Downey. \\\"We can't afford to let any of these businesses\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00eewhich together support hundreds of thousands of jobs and families across our state\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00eebe forgotten and left behind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We need to make sure that our economic recovery focuses first on Main Street\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00eeon the small businesses that form the backbone of our economy,\\\" said Assemblyman Eric Houghtaling. \\\"Many small stores, especially throughout the Jersey Shore, have desperately needed help in keeping the lights on. Now, with these commercial rental grants, many more will have the means to stay afloat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We are very happy Governor Murphy chose Long Branch as the location to announce this new initiative,\\\" said Long Branch Mayor John Pallone. \\\"This is going to be a real boost for businesses here in Long Branch and through out the state.\\\"\\n\\nThe NJRA Main Street Commercial Corridors Relief program is an excellent example of how the state and federal funding partnership is working together to help small businesses throughout NJ lead towards resilience,\\\" said Jackeline Mejias-Fuertes, Regional Director of the Small Business Development Center at Brookdale Community College. \\\"In addition, to giving small businesses a desperately needed \\\"lifeline\\\" that will not only keep businesses afloat but keep them alive.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"COVID-19 has created multiple, compounding challenges for small business owners. Ensuring they are able to survive the current crisis and rebuild their businesses requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the many difficulties they are facing,\\\" said NJEDA Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. \\\"We are proud to support the NJRA and Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver's insightful approach to helping business owners to stabilize their operations and navigate a path toward recovery. The SBL-EAGP program will relieve a major pain point for commercial tenants and landlords in impacted cities across the state.\\\"\"\n",

There you will also find a helpful chart clarifying different COVID-19 scenarios and the available protections and benefits in English and Spanish along with steps to apply for benefits.\\n\\nPrograms Available To Help\\n\\nNew Jersey has among the most comprehensive Earned Sick Leave, Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance laws in the country, which cover all employees -- full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal.\\n\\nIn addition, a new federal law passed in response to the coronavirus emergency requires private employers with fewer than 500 employees and most public employers to provide emergency paid sick leave and emergency childcare FMLA leave.\\n\\nNOTE: NJ Earned Sick Leave, emergency federal paid sick and emergency FMLA childcare leave are paid by your employer directly. Meanwhile, Unemployment, Temporary Disability and Family Leave benefits require an application to the State of NJ. Individuals should apply for the program that best fits their situation as applying for the wrong one could cause delays.\\n\\nAdditional COVID-19 Programs\\n\\nIf you're still employed, you may be eligible for the new federally mandated emergency paid sick leave and emergency FMLA childcare leave.\\n\\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires private employers with fewer than 500 employees and most public employers to provide emergency paid sick leave and emergency Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) for childcare.\\nEmployers pay their employees for the emergency leave and employers can take advantage of two new refundable payroll tax credits, designed to immediately and fully reimburse employers, dollar-for-dollar, for the cost of providing the leave.\\nSee NJDOL's publication What NJ Workers Need to Know About the Families First Coronavirus Response Act for more details.\\n\\nIf you take family leave, when you return to work, you are generally entitled to return to the same position you held before leave. Your employer may not retaliate against you because you took or attempted to take leave under the NJFLA. To find out more or to file a complaint, go to NJCivilRights.gov or call 973-648-2700.\\n\\nYou may also be eligible for help from Unemployment Insurance. The CARES Act that was signed March 27th has expanded Unemployment benefits, making it the optimal choice for many who cannot work because they, a family member, or a household member have been impacted by coronavirus.\\n\\nExpansion of Disability and Family Leave Insurance\\n\\nIn New Jersey, Governor Murphy has signed a new law expanding the State's Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) and Family Leave Insurance (FLI) programs to provide more workers with access to paid leave benefits during public health emergencies.\\n\\nIndividuals can now access TDI and FLI benefits during a public health emergency if they must take time off of work because they are diagnosed with or suspected of exposure to a communicable disease or to take care of a family member diagnosed with or suspected of exposure to a communicable disease.\\nIndividuals accessing FLI benefits are entitled to up to 12 weeks of family leave in a 24-month period without losing their jobs.\\n\\nPlease note that you cannot receive benefits from these programs and Unemployment Insurance at the same time. Learn more about TDI and FLI at myleavebenefits.nj.gov.\\n\\nFor more information, see NJ Workers: Frequently Asked Questions During the Coronavirus Emergency.\\n\\n\\\\\"\n",

During the coronavirus outbreak, new applicants will be assessed, certified and issued benefits remotely.\\n\\nSNAP UPDATES\\n\\nSimplified Application Process: During this public health crisis, the State is making the application process for SNAP food assistance simpler by removing some parts in the process. For example, a hard copy signature for your application and an interview are no longer required to apply for SNAP during this emergency. The online system has been updated to make it easier for SNAP applicants to track their application.\\n\\nYou can apply online at NJHelps.org or if you do not have a computer, you can apply by phone by calling your local board of social services. You can also download the application and mail it into the local board of social services.\\n\\nExtra SNAP Benefit: Eligible SNAP recipients will receive an extra SNAP benefit. The amount you receive will be the difference between your regular SNAP benefit and the maximum benefit for your family size. If you already receive the maximum benefit, you will not be eligible for this extra payment. As of May 8, the State has distributed an extra $106 million in additional benefits to SNAP recipients since the start of the emergency.\\n\\nExtra Benefits for Children: Special Pandemic-EBT benefits will be provided to recipients of SNAP with children who normally receive free or reduced-price school meals. Families will receive $416.10 for each eligible student for nutritional support during the time that schools have been closed during the pandemic. No application is necessary. The majority of Pandemic-EBT eligible families participating in SNAP will receive the benefit on their household's existing Families First card on July 8. All other Pandemic-EBT eligible households will be mailed a P-EBT card beginning the week of July 6th and should expect to receive their card in the mail starting the week of July 13th.\\n\\nSNAP Work Activities: During the current public health crisis, your case will not be closed if you are unable to participate in a work activity.\\n\\nSNAP Recertification Extension: If your case is due to be recertified in March, April, May or June and you are unable to get your paperwork in or complete your interview, your case will not be closed. You will receive your benefits on the usual day. Your case has been granted a six-month extension from the date your recertification is due, through September, October, November or December 2020. More information will follow on your new recertification date. In the meantime, you will continue to receive SNAP benefits.\\n\\nOnline Grocery Shopping; Beginning May 27, New Jerseyans enrolled SNAP will be able to use their benefits to order groceries online through Amazon and on May 28, through participating Walmarts, ShopRites and The Fresh Grocers. Recipients will be able to use their Families First Electronic Benefits Transfer card to purchase eligible groceries from the participating retailers. Under federal rules, SNAP benefits cannot be used to pay for delivery fees. Recipients can register their EBT card with Amazon at Amazon.com/SNAP. Visit here to learn about Walmart's SNAP online program. Any Walmart, ShopRite or The Fresh Grocer that currently provides online shopping will also accept online ordering with SNAP benefits.\\n\\nWOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN (WIC) UPDATES\\n\\nIn light of COVID-19, New Jersey WIC has made several important changes to better serve residents:\\n\\nNew participants can apply for WIC services remotely by visiting: wic.nj.gov/ParticipantPortal/, there is no need to be physically present at an WIC agency.\\nCurrent participants can continue to receive benefits by having 3 months' worth of checks mailed to their homes.\\nParticipants who are quarantined and unable to leave their homes to purchase foods, can designate an emergency proxy who can cash their checks at a store on their behalf.\\nFood choices have been expanded, giving participants more flexibility in the brand and size of foods they buy at the store.

More information will follow on your new recertification date. In the meantime, you will continue to receive WFNJ benefits.\\n\\nWFNJ Work Activities: During the current public health crisis, your case will not be closed if you are unable to participate in a work activity. This includes if you are a General Assistance (GA) client completing the 28-day work activity while your case is being reviewed.\"\n",

From there, you can apply for services or learn about additional resources.\\n\\nTo learn more about how to apply for affordable health coverage, visit http://www.njfamilycare.org/default.aspx.\\n\\nTo learn more about NJ SNAP and apply for help buying groceries, you can also visit, https://www.nj.gov/humanservices/njsnap/.\\n\\nTo apply for support through the NJ WIC Program (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children), applicants can visit https://nj.gov/health/fhs/wic/participants/find-wic and contact their local WIC office by phone. During the coronavirus outbreak, new applicants will be assessed, certified and issued benefits remotely.\\n\\nSNAP UPDATES\\n\\nSimplified Application Process: During this public health crisis, the State is making the application process for SNAP food assistance simpler by removing some parts in the process. For example, a hard copy signature for your application and an interview are no longer required to apply for SNAP during this emergency. The online system has been updated to make it easier for SNAP applicants to track their application.\\n\\nYou can apply online at NJHelps.org or if you do not have a computer, you can apply by phone by calling your local board of social services. You can also download the application and mail it into the local board of social services.\\n\\nExtra SNAP Benefit: Eligible SNAP recipients will receive an extra SNAP benefit. The amount you receive will be the difference between your regular SNAP benefit and the maximum benefit for your family size. If you already receive the maximum benefit, you will not be eligible for this extra payment. As of May 8, the State has distributed an extra $106 million in additional benefits to SNAP recipients since the start of the emergency.\\n\\nExtra Benefits for Children: Special Pandemic-EBT benefits will be provided to recipients of SNAP with children who normally receive free or reduced-price school meals. Families will receive $416.10 for each eligible student for nutritional support during the time that schools have been closed during the pandemic. No application is necessary. The majority of Pandemic-EBT eligible families participating in SNAP will receive the benefit on their household's existing Families First card on July 8. All other Pandemic-EBT eligible households will be mailed a P-EBT card beginning the week of July 6th and should expect to receive their card in the mail starting the week of July 13th.\\n\\nSNAP Work Activities: During the current public health crisis, your case will not be closed if you are unable to participate in a work activity.\\n\\nSNAP Recertification Extension: If your case is due to be recertified in March, April, May or June and you are unable to get your paperwork in or complete your interview, your case will not be closed. You will receive your benefits on the usual day. Your case has been granted a six-month extension from the date your recertification is due, through September, October, November or December 2020. More information will follow on your new recertification date. In the meantime, you will continue to receive SNAP benefits.\\n\\nOnline Grocery Shopping; Beginning May 27, New Jerseyans enrolled SNAP will be able to use their benefits to order groceries online through Amazon and on May 28, through participating Walmarts, ShopRites and The Fresh Grocers.

Any Walmart, ShopRite or The Fresh Grocer that currently provides online shopping will also accept online ordering with SNAP benefits.\\n\\nWOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN (WIC) UPDATES\\n\\nIn light of COVID-19, New Jersey WIC has made several important changes to better serve residents:\\n\\nNew participants can apply for WIC services remotely by visiting: wic.nj.gov/ParticipantPortal/, there is no need to be physically present at an WIC agency.\\nCurrent participants can continue to receive benefits by having 3 months' worth of checks mailed to their homes.\\nParticipants who are quarantined and unable to leave their homes to purchase foods, can designate an emergency proxy who can cash their checks at a store on their behalf.\\nFood choices have been expanded, giving participants more flexibility in the brand and size of foods they buy at the store. For more information, visit the NJ WIC website or check out their flyer.\\nThe State is working closely with their infant formula contractor to ensure formula supplies are fully stocked at stores.\\nThe State is also working closely with their authorized stores to ensure that limits placed on certain food items to customers are not placed on WIC participants.\\nThe State has modified WIC's farmers' markets program, allowing participants to receive their vouchers primarily by mail, unless a pickup arrangement can be set up safely. Participants can also designate a proxy to pick up their produce from the markets for them.\\n\\nWORK FIRST NEW JERSEY (WFNJ) UPDATES\\n\\nWFNJ Recertification Extension: If your case is due in March, April, or May to be recertified, the deadline has been extended 60 days. More information will follow on your new recertification date. In the meantime, you will continue to receive WFNJ benefits.\\n\\nWFNJ Work Activities: During the current public health crisis, your case will not be closed if you are unable to participate in a work activity. This includes if you are a General Assistance (GA) client completing the 28-day work activity while your case is being reviewed.\"\n",

These payments will be issued separately from regular unemployment benefits.\\nAn additional 13 weeks of benefits (known as \\\"Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation\\\")\\n\\nIn total, eligible claimants can now receive up to 59 weeks of unemployment benefits. New Jersey is providing 20 weeks of extended unemployment to New Jersey workers who have exhausted their state and federal jobless benefits. The state extension kicks in after claimants exhaust 26 weeks of state unemployment plus 13 weeks of federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.\\n\\nTo apply, visit myunemployment.nj.gov.\\n\\nNOTE: Applicants will be assessed first for traditional unemployment insurance benefits. If traditional unemployment benefits are not applicable to that worker, the application may be denied first and then assessed by NJ Department of Labor for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits.\\n\\nFor more information, the Department of Labor has created a Frequently Asked Questions During the Coronavirus Emergency for NJ Workers resource guide.\\n\\nWhat if I can't safely quarantine at home?\\n\\nWhen a contact tracer calls, they will discuss any needs you may have, inquire about your living situation, and connect you with additional support if you require help.

In addition, those institutions will:\\n\\nProvide borrowers a streamlined process to request a forbearance for COVID-19-related reasons, supported with available documentation;\\nConfirm approval of and terms of forbearance program; and\\nProvide borrowers the opportunity to request additional relief, as practicable, upon continued showing of hardship due to COVID-19.\\n\\nThe Department of Banking and Insurance has requested that banks add forbearance payments to the end of the life of the loan, rather than requiring a consumer to make a lump sum payment after the 90-day grace period ends. However, specific terms of forbearance plans are set by the investor of your loan.\\n\\nAs of this writing, forbearance programs for loans backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration do not allow for adding forbearance payments to the end of the loan term. Governor Murphy has been advocating for this change with the federal government.\\n\\nConsumers should contact the institution that services their home loan to understand the specific programs and terms available to them. Following the forbearance period, some institutions may offer borrowers the option of amortizing the payments over a period time or over the entire term of the loan.\\n\\nNo Negative Credit Impacts Resulting from Relief: Financial institutions will not report derogatory tradelines (e.g., late payments) to credit reporting agencies, consistent with applicable guidelines, for borrowers taking advantage of COVID-19-related relief.\\n\\nRelief from Fees and Charges: For at least 90 days, financial institutions will waive or refund at least the following for customers who have requested assistance:\\n\\nMortgage-related late fees; and\\nOther fees, including early CD withdrawals (subject to applicable federal regulations).\\n\\nHomeowners should contact lenders directly to take advantage of this relief. These lenders are experiencing high volumes of inquiries and may recommend using online services when available. Loans held by a financial institution may be serviced by another company.\\n\\nNote: Most forbearance programs require the institution that services your loan to pay property taxes and insurance during the grace period, even if you do not make a payment. However, consumers will be responsible for making up these property taxes and insurance payments. Consumers should contact the institution that services their loan to determine whether the institution will make the payments initially, or if there are other requirements for making these payments.\\n\\nIf your bank or mortgage service is not cooperative, you can file a complaint online with the Department of Banking and Insurance or by calling (609) 292-7272 or 1-800-446-7467.\\n\\nTo further aid homeowners facing hardship, the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency offers homeowners free counseling through its Foreclosure Mediation Assistance Program (FMAP). Counseling is free, available now, and can be provided remotely. Counselors will provide assistance to help homeowners avoid potential foreclosure.\\n\\nFor a list of housing counselors participating in FMAP, visit: https://njhousing.gov/foreclosure\\n\\nFor more information on COVID19-related mortgage relief and answers to frequently asked questions, please visit: https://www.state.nj.us/dobi/covid/mortgagerelief.html\"\n",

These payments will be issued separately from regular unemployment benefits.\\nAn additional 13 weeks of benefits (known as \\\"Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation\\\")\\n\\nIn total, eligible claimants can now receive up to 59 weeks of unemployment benefits. New Jersey is providing 20 weeks of extended unemployment to New Jersey workers who have exhausted their state and federal jobless benefits. The state extension kicks in after claimants exhaust 26 weeks of state unemployment plus 13 weeks of federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.\\n\\nTo apply, visit myunemployment.nj.gov.\\n\\nNOTE: Applicants will be assessed first for traditional unemployment insurance benefits. If traditional unemployment benefits are not applicable to that worker, the application may be denied first and then assessed by NJ Department of Labor for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits.\\n\\nFor more information, the Department of Labor has created a Frequently Asked Questions During the Coronavirus Emergency for NJ Workers resource guide.\\n\\nWhat if I can't safely quarantine at home?\\n\\nWhen a contact tracer calls, they will discuss any needs you may have, inquire about your living situation, and connect you with additional support if you require help.

In addition, those institutions will:\\n\\nProvide borrowers a streamlined process to request a forbearance for COVID-19-related reasons, supported with available documentation;\\nConfirm approval of and terms of forbearance program; and\\nProvide borrowers the opportunity to request additional relief, as practicable, upon continued showing of hardship due to COVID-19.\\n\\nThe Department of Banking and Insurance has requested that banks add forbearance payments to the end of the life of the loan, rather than requiring a consumer to make a lump sum payment after the 90-day grace period ends. However, specific terms of forbearance plans are set by the investor of your loan.\\n\\nAs of this writing, forbearance programs for loans backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration do not allow for adding forbearance payments to the end of the loan term. Governor Murphy has been advocating for this change with the federal government.\\n\\nConsumers should contact the institution that services their home loan to understand the specific programs and terms available to them. Following the forbearance period, some institutions may offer borrowers the option of amortizing the payments over a period time or over the entire term of the loan.\\n\\nNo Negative Credit Impacts Resulting from Relief: Financial institutions will not report derogatory tradelines (e.g., late payments) to credit reporting agencies, consistent with applicable guidelines, for borrowers taking advantage of COVID-19-related relief.\\n\\nRelief from Fees and Charges: For at least 90 days, financial institutions will waive or refund at least the following for customers who have requested assistance:\\n\\nMortgage-related late fees; and\\nOther fees, including early CD withdrawals (subject to applicable federal regulations).\\n\\nHomeowners should contact lenders directly to take advantage of this relief. These lenders are experiencing high volumes of inquiries and may recommend using online services when available. Loans held by a financial institution may be serviced by another company.\\n\\nNote: Most forbearance programs require the institution that services your loan to pay property taxes and insurance during the grace period, even if you do not make a payment. However, consumers will be responsible for making up these property taxes and insurance payments. Consumers should contact the institution that services their loan to determine whether the institution will make the payments initially, or if there are other requirements for making these payments.\\n\\nIf your bank or mortgage service is not cooperative, you can file a complaint online with the Department of Banking and Insurance or by calling (609) 292-7272 or 1-800-446-7467.\\n\\nTo further aid homeowners facing hardship, the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency offers homeowners free counseling through its Foreclosure Mediation Assistance Program (FMAP). Counseling is free, available now, and can be provided remotely. Counselors will provide assistance to help homeowners avoid potential foreclosure.\\n\\nFor a list of housing counselors participating in FMAP, visit: https://njhousing.gov/foreclosure\\n\\nFor more information on COVID19-related mortgage relief and answers to frequently asked questions, please visit: https://www.state.nj.us/dobi/covid/mortgagerelief.html\"\n",

The rule waiver, which takes effect immediately, will remain in place throughout the COVID-19 state of emergency.\\nMobilizing nurse care managers at Medicaid health plans to call high risk populations to identify and address their critical needs including supplies such as durable medical equipment and food;\\nAllowing older residents receiving prescription drugs through Medicaid or the state prescription drug assistance program (PAAD and Senior Gold) to refill their prescriptions early, receive 90-day supplies of maintenance medications, and waiving signature requirements to reduce in-person contact;\\nPartnering with counties to end congregate dining in senior centers while helping to ensure that participants continue to have access to food;\\nWorking with counties to support telephone outreach to seniors known to be socially isolated;\\nEncouraging health care providers to use telehealth for routine visits, as appropriate;\\nWorking closely with community and institutional providers to ensure resident needs are met; and\\nConducting telephonic outreach for our most vulnerable residents seeking enrollment in social service benefits.\\n\\nWith senior centers and nutrition sites closed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the State is working with county-based Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) to safely deliver meals to older New Jerseyans most at risk of going hungry. Seniors unable to prepare their meals and have no family member, friend, neighbor, or caregiver to help, should contact their county AAA for assistance.\\n\\nThe State has also modified the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP), which provides vouchers to farmers' markets, to ensure food assistance remains safe and accessible throughout the pandemic.\\n\\nAll certifications and re-certifications will be done remotely via telephone. Participants can complete a self-declaration of income and won't need to show proof of income eligibility for the program. Seniors can designate several proxies to pick up their produce on their behalf to limit risk of exposure. To learn more or to apply, visit the NJ Department of Health's Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program site.\\n\\nIn addition, through NJ Save, low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities save money on Medicare premiums, prescription costs, and other living expenses. Seniors can see if they qualify and apply online here: https://njdoas-ua.force.com/njsave/quickstart\\n\\nFor Medicare counseling and general aging services questions call 1-800-792-8820\\n\\nFor NJ Save (PAAD, Sr. Gold, Medicare Saving Programs, Lifeline, and more) call 1-800-792-9745\\n\\nFor access to aging services in your county call 1-877-222-3737\\n\\nAdditional resources for older residents can be found here.\"\n",

More details about each of these programs can be found on the EDA's website.\\n\\nMicro Business Loan Program: Through this program, the NJEDA makes financing of up to $50,000 available to New Jersey businesses, which can use the financing for working capital or to purchase equipment. To ensure that the financing is accessible to the early-stage and micro businesses that need it most, to qualify, a business must fewer than ten employees and no greater than $1.5 million in revenues. On June, 9, NJEDA announced an expansion of its Micro Business Loan Program to assist New Jersey small businesses, many of which are facing business interruption as a result of COVID-19.\\n\\nThe expanded program will provide financing up to $50,000 to businesses for inventory, equipment, and working capital. Loans will have a standard ten-year term. Interest rates will be set at 2 percent with no interest and no payment due for the first three years. Businesses that receive financing under the enhanced program and are still in operation 12 months after the closing date of the loan will have ten percent of the approved loan amount forgiven.\\n\\nThe expanded Micro Business Loan Program is open to for-profit businesses with a business location in New Jersey, as well as home-based businesses and not-for-profit organizations that have been in operation for at least two years. Startup businesses, defined under the program as business in operation between six months and one year, may also be eligible for the program, but will be required to provide a business plan and five-year projections at application. The NJEDA will capitalize the program with $10 million. Of the $10 million in total funding available, $3.5 million will be set aside to support eligible entities located in New Jersey Opportunity Zone-eligible census tracts.\\n\\nThe application for the expanded Micro Business Loan Program is currently in development, and is expected to be available soon. Recognizing the extraordinary economic circumstances that make this program necessary, the NJEDA will waive all fees for three months from the date the application is opened.\\n\\nSmall Business Fund - The Small Business Fund offers loans of up to $500,000 for qualifying creditworthy small, minority- or women-owned businesses in New Jersey with up to $3 million in revenue that have been in operation for at least one full year and may not have the ability to get bank financing.

More details about each of these programs can be found on the EDA's website.\\n\\nMicro Business Loan Program: Through this program, the NJEDA makes financing of up to $50,000 available to New Jersey businesses, which can use the financing for working capital or to purchase equipment. To ensure that the financing is accessible to the early-stage and micro businesses that need it most, to qualify, a business must fewer than ten employees and no greater than $1.5 million in revenues. On June, 9, NJEDA announced an expansion of its Micro Business Loan Program to assist New Jersey small businesses, many of which are facing business interruption as a result of COVID-19.\\n\\nThe expanded program will provide financing up to $50,000 to businesses for inventory, equipment, and working capital. Loans will have a standard ten-year term. Interest rates will be set at 2 percent with no interest and no payment due for the first three years. Businesses that receive financing under the enhanced program and are still in operation 12 months after the closing date of the loan will have ten percent of the approved loan amount forgiven.\\n\\nThe expanded Micro Business Loan Program is open to for-profit businesses with a business location in New Jersey, as well as home-based businesses and not-for-profit organizations that have been in operation for at least two years. Startup businesses, defined under the program as business in operation between six months and one year, may also be eligible for the program, but will be required to provide a business plan and five-year projections at application. The NJEDA will capitalize the program with $10 million. Of the $10 million in total funding available, $3.5 million will be set aside to support eligible entities located in New Jersey Opportunity Zone-eligible census tracts.\\n\\nThe application for the expanded Micro Business Loan Program is currently in development, and is expected to be available soon. Recognizing the extraordinary economic circumstances that make this program necessary, the NJEDA will waive all fees for three months from the date the application is opened.\\n\\nSmall Business Fund - The Small Business Fund offers loans of up to $500,000 for qualifying creditworthy small, minority- or women-owned businesses in New Jersey with up to $3 million in revenue that have been in operation for at least one full year and may not have the ability to get bank financing. Not-for-profit corporations that have been operating for at least three full years may also be eligible for assistance under the Small Business Fund.\\n\\nDirect Loans - Direct loans are available up to $2 million for fixed assets, and $750,000 for working capital. New Jersey businesses in need of financing and committed to job creation/retention may be eligible for direct loans through the EDA when conventional financing is not available. EDA's direct loan financing offers competitive interest rates and terms.\\n\\nPremier Lender Program - In partnership with two dozen banks throughout New Jersey, The Premier Lender Program offers up to a $2 million loan participation or $1.5 million loan guarantee for fixed assets, and up to a $750,000 loan participation or $1.5 million guarantee for term working capital.

By using a combination of models, we have been able to achieve accurate predictions for 10-day forecasts, and have also established long-term forecasts.\\n\\nMore specifically, to account for the aggressive social distancing policy in New Jersey, we have developed multiple adaptive growth models using Multivariate Hawkes processes and control theory principles for short-term forecasting -- these models were developed by researchers at New York University and Facebook AI research. For long-term forecasting, the State uses multiple models including dynamic versions of SIR models and SEIR models, and \\\"stay at home\\\" growth variation modeling using transfer learning algorithms developed by researchers at New York University. The State is also continuously monitoring the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model as well as the COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME), developed by University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine's Predictive Healthcare Team.\\n\\nShort-Term Forecasting\\n\\nAdaptive Growth Model with Cross-County Clustering: In this model, developed by Lakshmi Subramanian of the NYU Courant Institute and Srikanth Jagabathula of the NYU Stern School of Business, we directly estimate the growth rate of new confirmed cases at a county level using a learning rate equation commonly used in control theory and gradient descent algorithms. We used exponential smoothing of the parameter inputs to account for county-level spikes, reporting, and testing fluctuations. We use cross-county clustering to learn early growth rate variations in counties with very limited data and smooth the variations across counties.\\nMultivariate Hawkes Process: Another model the State uses for short-term forecasting, developed by Facebook's AI team, trains a multivariate Hawkes process (which is commonly used in financial stock price modeling) to train a county-level model and a collective state-level model.\\n\\nBoth these models are re-trained on a daily basis and provide 7-14 day forecasts.\\n\\nLong-Term Forecasting\\n\\nDynamic SIR: The SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model is widely used for epidemiology modeling. The CHIME (COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics) tool uses the SIR model, but manually sets the parameters of the SIR model based on doubling time and social distancing. While the CHIME model does leverage a social distancing parameter, the State also uses a dynamic SIR model that adapts the mixing rate (which captures the number of people each infected person comes in contact with) parameter based on the data observed in growth rate variations at a county level to provide an additional long-term model that further captures the impact of the \\\"stay at home\\\" order currently in place in New Jersey.\\nDynamic SEIR model: Expanding upon our Dynamic SIR model, we trained the parameters of an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) model in a dynamic manner at a county level based on the growth variations observed in the data at a county and state level. The dynamic SEIR model - developed by Subramanian and Jagabathula - uses the growth variations to adaptively adjust the SEIR parameters, in essence, varying the R0 value of the epidemiology model over time to capture the impact of the \\\"stay at home\\\" order currently in place in New Jersey.\\n\\\"Stay at Home\\\" Growth Variation Modeling using Transfer Learning: Traditional epidemiology models do not capture movement limitation behavior. To account for that, in this model - also developed by Subramanian and Jagabathula - we study the growth-rate variations in other countries after \\\"stay at home\\\" orders have been issues and use transfer learning to determine the appropriate growth variations that best fit the data for New Jersey. This model is especially useful for learning best case, expected case, and worst-case scenarios of peaks.\\n\\nWith the help of this ensemble of forecasts, the State is better able to make difficult decisions on what critical resources to acquire, where to deploy these critical resources, anticipate potential hot spots, and ensure that those who need care can get it when they need it most.\"\n",

Infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Amesh Adalja suggests that COVID-19 is akin to the seasonal cold and predicts some \\\"tapering off of cases\\\" as we head into spring and summer in the northern hemisphere, while the virus may have increased transmission in parts of the southern hemisphere. Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci is also hopeful that cases will diminish as the weather becomes warmer, but both he and others caution that we don't have enough information to predict the seasonal behavior of the virus (see Australia, which is currently in its warm season, yet still experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks).\\n\\nIf we look to the timelines of other countries for comparison: in the US, the rapidly increasing number of cases resembles the beginning of an exponential curve - similar to Italy. However, cases in China and South Korea are beginning to decrease, suggesting they may have begun to \\\"plateau.\\\" It took approximately two months for China to reach this stage from the beginning of the outbreak and South Korea roughly half a month, although due to differences in response times, testing, and approaches to tracing cases / public health interventions, it may be difficult to extrapolate what has happened in other countries to the US.\\n\\nIn the US, it is difficult to tell when the peak will arrive, partly due to the limitations in testing. Additionally, we may see second or third waves of outbreaks even after cases begin to decrease. Therefore, while it may not be unreasonable to hope for an end sometime in late April or May based on these predictions and cases, we simply do not have enough information to say for certain.\\n\\nMore information can be found in the sources below:\\n\\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/16/social-distancing-coronavirus/\\n\\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/12/805256402/can-coronavirus-be-crushed-by-warmer-weather\\n\\nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\\n\\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/17/21181694/coronavirus-covid-19-lockdowns-end-how-long-months-years\\n\\nDrafted 19 March 2020\"\n",

It is part of the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infection.\\n\\nHere's how it works:\\n\\nWhen you test positive for COVID-19, in addition to providing you with support, the lab that tested you loads your test data onto the State's secure epidemiological surveillance system called the Communicable Disease Reporting and Surveillance System (CDRSS).\\nYour positive case is then shared with your Local Health Department, who will call you to determine close contacts that you may have spread the virus to.\\nA close contact is anyone who was within six feet of you for more than 10 minutes at least two days before your positive test if you didn't have any symptoms, or two days before your first symptom appeared.\\nContact tracers \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec trained professionals from the community -- get in touch with your contacts to recommend next steps like self-quarantining and to share resources about how those people can get tested.\\nNOTE: Your information is confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status\\nContacts are provided with education, information, and support to understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, how they should monitor themselves for illness, and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they themselves do not feel ill.\\nLocal Health Departments across New Jersey have been conducting contact tracing for COVID-19 since the State identified the first case on March 4. However, as the case count has grown, Local Health Departments need more help getting this critical job done.\\nThe information that Local Health Departments are collecting is limited in scope, detail, use, and dissemination solely to what's necessary to identify, trace, contain, and treat COVID-19.\\n\\nFor COVID-19, the ability to scale our contact tracing capacity is absolutely crucial to break the chain of transmission, slow community spread, and restart the economy.\\n\\nIt is important to note that contact tracing is a decades-old common practice in public health. It is not the same thing as \\\"exposure notification\\\" or \\\"digital alerting\\\" tools. These consumer apps, such as those created with Google and Apple's API, are not contact tracing tools. These apps function as a way for the public to track if they have come into contact with a person who has tested positive and entered that information into their phone.\\n\\nThe State of New Jersey is neither pursuing nor promoting exposure notification or digital alerting technology at this time. We are also careful to refer to such apps as exposure notification or digital alerting tools to avoid confusing the public with contact tracing.\\n\\nNOTE: If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of your conversation with a contact tracer, you may hang up and call your local health department. You should also feel free to request the name and ID of anyone who calls.\\n\\nYou can find your local health department's contact information through the Department of Health's directory.\"\n",

The State of New Jersey is neither pursuing nor promoting exposure notification or digital alerting technology at this time.\\n\\nIt's also important to underscore that your information remains confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec- and the information you share will not be used for the purposes of law enforcement or immigration enforcement in any way.

It is part of the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infection.\\n\\nHere's how it works:\\n\\nWhen you test positive for COVID-19, in addition to providing you with support, the lab that tested you loads your test data onto the State's secure epidemiological surveillance system called the Communicable Disease Reporting and Surveillance System (CDRSS).\\nYour positive case is then shared with your Local Health Department, who will call you to determine close contacts that you may have spread the virus to.\\nA close contact is anyone who was within six feet of you for more than 10 minutes at least two days before your positive test if you didn't have any symptoms, or two days before your first symptom appeared.\\nContact tracers \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec trained professionals from the community -- get in touch with your contacts to recommend next steps like self-quarantining and to share resources about how those people can get tested.\\nNOTE: Your information is confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status\\nContacts are provided with education, information, and support to understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, how they should monitor themselves for illness, and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they themselves do not feel ill.\\nLocal Health Departments across New Jersey have been conducting contact tracing for COVID-19 since the State identified the first case on March 4. However, as the case count has grown, Local Health Departments need more help getting this critical job done.\\nThe information that Local Health Departments are collecting is limited in scope, detail, use, and dissemination solely to what's necessary to identify, trace, contain, and treat COVID-19.\\n\\nFor COVID-19, the ability to scale our contact tracing capacity is absolutely crucial to break the chain of transmission, slow community spread, and restart the economy.\\n\\nIt is important to note that contact tracing is a decades-old common practice in public health. It is not the same thing as \\\"exposure notification\\\" or \\\"digital alerting\\\" tools. These consumer apps, such as those created with Google and Apple's API, are not contact tracing tools. These apps function as a way for the public to track if they have come into contact with a person who has tested positive and entered that information into their phone.\\n\\nThe State of New Jersey is neither pursuing nor promoting exposure notification or digital alerting technology at this time. We are also careful to refer to such apps as exposure notification or digital alerting tools to avoid confusing the public with contact tracing.\\n\\nNOTE: If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of your conversation with a contact tracer, you may hang up and call your local health department. You should also feel free to request the name and ID of anyone who calls.\\n\\nYou can find your local health department's contact information through the Department of Health's directory.\"\n",

To mitigate the impact of the temporary measure, the Department is increasing access to other forms of communication including:\\n\\nExpanding inmate and resident access to additional phone calls, free-of-charge.\\nExpanding inmate and resident access to additional JPay kiosk usage\\nProviding the inmate and Residential Community Release Program population access to free postage.\\n\\nLegal visitation is unaffected.\\n\\nFor more information, please refer to this document from the Department of Corrections.\\n\\nHealth Precautions And Testing\\n\\nIn consultation with the Department of Health, the Department of Corrections is taking steps to protect those in custody, employees, and visitors from COVID-19 including:\\n\\nConducting health screenings of all individuals entering its facilities\\nProviding all inmates and residents with face masks\\nCompleting universal baseline testing of staff, inmates, and residents at all Corrections Facilities, Residential Release Programs, and Assessment Centers. For more information about cases and deaths, visit the DOC COVID-19 dashboard.\\nInmates with known exposure to COVID-19 are quarantined in a specifically designated quarantine unit within the facility, and the Department is providing alternative housing for its staff who have been exposed to COVID-19.\\nLimiting foot traffic in facilities, with the implementation of flexible work arrangements for non-essential personnel that includes a reduced and rotational workforce.\\nModifying, suspending, or minimizing group activities, dining, recreation, religious gatherings, and education to minimize potential exposure and encourage social distancing. For example, individuals are provided access to religious materials and for the time being are encouraged to practice their faith in their living quarters. Also, educational programs have been adapted in support of independent study.\\n\\nMore information about the steps DOC has taken during this time along with the number of confirmed cases at DOC prisons, halfway houses, and other locations can be found here: https://njdoc.gov/pages/COVID19Updates.shtml\\n\\nLow-level Offender Release\\n\\nOn April 10, Governor Murphy signed an Executive Order, establishing a process by which the Department of Corrections may grant temporary reprieve to certain at-risk inmates during the public health emergency. This creates the Emergency Medical Review Committee to make recommendations on which inmates should be placed on temporary home confinement through the Commissioner's statutory furlough authority. All recommendations to place an individual on home confinement will be made after thorough review and consideration of the conditions that an individual may face in the community.\\n\\nThe four categories for priority early release include individuals aged 60 years or older; individuals with high risk medical conditions, as determined by DOC in consultation with the Department of Health; individuals whose sentences expire within the next three months; and individuals who were denied parole within the last year. Individuals who have been convicted of a serious offense, including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or any offense subject to the No Early Release Act, will be ineligible for temporary reprieve.\\n\\nOn March 22, the New Jersey Supreme Court issued an order to suspend or commute county jail sentences for low-risk inmates. The order commutes or suspends county jail sentences currently being served by county jail inmates either as a condition of probation for an indictable offense or because of a municipal court conviction. At the conclusion of the public health emergency, those released from jail will appear before the court to determine whether their custodial sentences should be reinstated or commuted. No-contact orders, drivers' license suspensions, and other conditions will remain in force.\"\n",

This creates the Emergency Medical Review Committee to make recommendations on which inmates should be placed on temporary home confinement through the Commissioner's statutory furlough authority. All recommendations to place an individual on home confinement will be made after thorough review and consideration of the conditions that an individual may face in the community.\\n\\nThe four categories for priority early release include individuals aged 60 years or older; individuals with high risk medical conditions, as determined by DOC in consultation with the Department of Health; individuals whose sentences expire within the next three months; and individuals who were denied parole within the last year. Individuals who have been convicted of a serious offense, including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or any offense subject to the No Early Release Act, will be ineligible for temporary reprieve.\\n\\nOn March 22, the New Jersey Supreme Court issued an order to suspend or commute county jail sentences for low-risk inmates. The order commutes or suspends county jail sentences currently being served by county jail inmates either as a condition of probation for an indictable offense or because of a municipal court conviction. At the conclusion of the public health emergency, those released from jail will appear before the court to determine whether their custodial sentences should be reinstated or commuted. No-contact orders, drivers' license suspensions, and other conditions will remain in force.\"\n",

The Charity Care and Graduate Medical Education funds will be an advance of remaining fiscal year 2020 budget allocations for those programs.\\n\\nCOVID-19 Aid Program\\nThe COVID-19 Aid program is a $6 million loan program to offset some of the unforeseen expenses incurred by this pandemic. Loans will:\\n\\nHave no application, initial or annual fees;\\nBe at an interest rate of 0%;\\nBe secured solely by federal and State grants and other financial aid received by the recipient health care organizations as a response to COVID-19, as well as grants from other private and public sources related to COVID-19 resilience (together \\\"COVID-19 Aid\\\") and anything acquired with the proceeds thereof.\\n\\nHealth care organizations that wish to apply can find a loan application and more program information on the New Jersey Health Care Facilities Financing Authority's COVID-19 Aid Emergency Loan resource page.\\n\\nDecisions on the loan recipients will be made according to the priority and amounts set by a committee consisting of the New Jersey Commissioner of Health or her designee, the Executive Director of the Authority and the Authority's Director of Research, Investor Relations and Compliance. Additionally the loan will specify how the requested funds will be used: for instance, the acquisition of any property, or acquisition, construction or renovation of any building, acquisition of any equipment, including ventilators, acquisition of any supplies, medications or personal protective equipment, hiring of any staff, consultants or temporary workers, or reopening formerly closed hospital beds/wings, etc.\\n\\nPrincipal payments would be required within 30 days of receipt of any COVID-19 Aid by the recipient health care organization in the amount of such COVID-19 Aid received, if any, until the loan is fully repaid.\\n\\nFederal Aid\\n\\nOn May 2, Governor Murphy announced that 53 hospitals in New Jersey will receive $1.7 billion from the federal government.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.\\n\\nIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\\n\\nPeople should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask).\\n\\nCleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens\\n\\nare expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.\"\n",

CDC will update this interim guidance as needed as additional information becomes available. For breastfeeding guidance in the immediate postpartum setting, refer to Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of 2019 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings.\\n\\nTransmission of COVID-19 through breast milk\\n\\nMuch is unknown about how COVID-19 is spread. Person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza (flu) and other respiratory pathogens spread. In limited studies on women with COVID-19 and another coronavirus infection, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), the virus has not been detected in breast milk; however we do not know whether mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus via breast milk.\\n\\nCDC breastfeeding guidance for other infectious illnesses\\n\\nBreast milk provides protection against many illnesses. There are rare exceptions when breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk is not recommended. CDC has no specific guidance for breastfeeding during infection with similar viruses like SARS-CoV or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).\\n\\nOutside of the immediate postpartum setting, CDC recommends that a mother with flu continue breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk to her infant while taking precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant.\\n\\nGuidance on breastfeeding for mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or under investigation for COVID-19\\n\\nBreast milk is the best source of nutrition for most infants. However, much is unknown about COVID-19. Whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding should be determined by the mother in coordination with her family and healthcare providers. A mother with confirmed COVID-19 or who is a symptomatic PUI should take all possible precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant, including washing her hands before touching the infant and wearing a face mask, if possible, while feeding at the breast. If expressing breast milk with a manual or electric breast pump, the mother should wash her hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning after each use. If possible, consider having someone who is well feed the expressed breast milk to the infant.\"\n",

Historically, convalescent plasma has been used as a potentially life-saving treatment in situations when new diseases or infections develop quickly, and no treatments or vaccines were available yet.\\n\\nEligible individuals must be fully recovered from COVID-19 and symptom free, and must otherwise meet regular blood donation eligibility criteria. Individuals are encouraged to register to donate at RedCrossBlood.org/plasma4covid.

University Hospital is one of the first hospitals in the state to receive the FDA approval for convalescent plasma treatment in New Jersey and remains one of only a few hospitals in the state offering this treatment. Approximately 100 COVID-19 patients at University Hospital have been treated with convalescent plasma. The effectiveness of this treatment is not yet known \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec but many patients that have received this therapy at University Hospital have recovered, which is a promising sign.

The Department of Health has issued a Directive with measures that must be in place to reduce risks, including:\\n\\nA resident who is suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 or quarantined for a COVID-19 exposure cannot have visitors. A resident who has tested positive is allowed visitation after they have met the criteria for discontinuation of isolation.\\nThere will only be two visitors permitted at a time and the visitors must remain at least 6 feet away from the resident. Both visitors and residents must wear face coverings.\\nA staff member, wearing a surgical mask, must remain with the resident during the visit.\\nA designated area should be established for visitors to be screened that maintains social distancing and infection control standards. If the individual has any COVID-19 symptoms, they will not be permitted to visit with a resident.\\nVisitors are not allowed beyond the reception area of the facilities and restrooms will not be available to them.\\nWhen staff are transporting the resident outdoors, they cannot be moved through any space where either positive or suspected COVID patients are cohorted. A safe distance of 6 feet distance must be maintained between other residents and staff.\\nLong-term care facilities should communicate the visitor policy to residents, families, staff and others. They should receive informed consent from the resident and the visitor in writing that they are aware of the possible dangers of COVID-19 exposure and that they will comply with the facility's policies during the visit. As part of the consent form, the visitor must agree to notify the facility if they test positive for the virus or have symptoms within 14 days of visiting.\\n\\nFor a full list of safety requirements, refer to the Department of Health Executive Directive 20-017.\\n\\nEnd-Of-Life Visitation\\n\\nDuring end-of-life situations, healthy visitors are permitted within long-term care facilities, assisted living residences, dementia care homes, pediatric transitional care homes, and comprehensive personal care homes.\\n\\nHealthy is defined as individuals with no signs of respiratory illness such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. They should not have had contact with anyone with or suspected of having COVID-19 or any respiratory illness and individuals should be wearing the appropriate protective equipment.\\n\\nFor a full list of safety requirements refer to Department of Health Executive Guidance 20-017.\\n\\nIf residents or their families need emotional support as a result of difficulties related to the pandemic\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00eesuch as an extended absence from each other\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00eethere are resources available to help.\\n\\nYou can call New Jersey's toll-free hotline and speak with counselors 7 days a week at 1-866-202-HELP (4357).\\n\\nVisiting Pediatric, Developmentally Disabled, and Intellectually Disabled Residents\\n\\nIn addition to outdoor visits, parents, family, and legal guardians of pediatric, developmentally disabled, and intellectually disabled residents may visit their loved ones indoors at long-term care facilities.\\n\\nDue to how medically fragile these residents are, visits are by appointment only, health screenings and temperature checks are required, and may only occur at facilities that have had no new probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases in the last 28 days. Visitors must wear face coverings.\\n\\nFor a full list of safety requirements, refer to Department of Health Executive Directive No. 20-025.\\n\\nNew Jersey's Measures to Protect Long-Term Care Facilities\\n\\nCOVID-19 has devastated long-term care facilities and nursing homes in New Jersey and across the nation. In an effort to protect the lives of residents and staff at these facilities, the State has taken a number aggressive measures including:\\n\\nCurtailing visitation on March 14, and requiring screening for symptoms and temperature checks of all individuals who enter the facilities\\nDeveloping a comprehensive testing plan for residents and staff; baseline testing was completed for all residents and staff by the end of May and retesting continues for residents and staff who have tested negative; as of July 22, 232,000 tests have been completed on residents and 367,000 tests for staff\\nIn partnership with the VA, universal baseline testing of all residents and staff has been completed at all three veterans memorial homes \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec Paramus, Menlo Park, and Vineland\\nThe positivity rate for long-term care residents has been reduced from 6% in May to less than 1% in July, and the positivity rate for staff has fallen from 3% in May to less than 1% in July\\nIncreasing the personal protective equipment (PPE) available to these facilities; as of July 22, the State has distributed more than 30 million pieces of PPE to long term care facilities\\nAllowing facilities to hire out-of-state, certified nurse aides to support staffing vacancies\\nEnforcing mandatory notification of residents, families and staff of an outbreak in their facilities, and requiring universal masking\\nProhibiting admissions to facilities that could not cohort patients and staff\\nDeploying over 300 New Jersey National Guard members to long-term care facilities to provide additional staffing and support\\nDeploying an additional 40 VA clinical staff to New Jersey as part of strike force teams to help at our long-term care centers\\nRequiring facilities to confirm mandated updates to their outbreak prevention plans\\n\\nGovernor Murphy has announced a series of recommendations and actions from Manatt Health's review of New Jersey's long-term centers. Manatt Health provided several recommendations to improve quality, safety, and resilience within New Jersey's long-term care system. New Jersey has implemented several key recommendations, including substantially clearing a backlog of more than 4,000 complaints, completing infection control focused surveys in 449 facilities, and setting up a central Long-Term Care Emergency Operations Center.\\n\\nIn addition, the State is working to support facilities during this health crisis. In April, State surveyors inspected 60 facilities to examine infection control procedures, staffing levels, the availability of PPE, and outbreak response plans -- which includes family notification.\\n\\nIn several instances, surveys resulted in the issuance of directed plans of correction and some facilities were directed to bring on consultants in nursing and infection control.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in response to the significant number of deaths and disturbing complaints about these facilities, on April 16, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office opened an investigation into the state's long-term care facilities.\\n\\nIf you have first-hand knowledge of illegal activity or other misconduct at a nursing home or a long-term care facility during the COVID-19 outbreak, please fill out this online reporting form (covid19.nj.gov/ltc) from the New Jersey Attorney General's Office.\"\n",

Administrative Order 2020-01 imposes state wide restrictions on prescribing and dispensing of drugs. This is to protect the supply of certain drugs being investigated for their potential in treating COVID-19. Violations can be reported to the State Board of Medical Examiners.\\n\\nCommon COVID-Related Scams\\n\\nContact Tracing scams: Scammers posing as contact tracers are attempting to steal private information. New Jersey contact tracers will never ask for your social security number or sensitive financial details like your bank or credit card number.\\nTreatment scams: Scammers are offering to sell fake cures, vaccines, and advice on unproven treatments for COVID-19.\\nSupply scams: Scammers are creating fake shops, websites, social media accounts, and email addresses claiming to sell medical supplies currently in high demand, such as surgical masks. When consumers attempt to purchase supplies through these channels, fraudsters pocket the money and never provide the promised supplies.\\nProvider scams: Scammers are also contacting people by phone and email, pretending to be doctors and hospitals that have treated a friend or relative for COVID-19, and demanding payment for that treatment.\\nCharity scams: Scammers are soliciting donations for individuals, groups, and areas affected by COVID-19.\\nPhishing scams: Scammers posing as national and global health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are sending phishing emails designed to trick recipients into downloading malware or providing personal identifying and financial information.\\nApp scams: Scammers are also creating and manipulating mobile apps designed to track the spread of COVID-19 to insert malware that will compromise users' devices and personal information.\\nInvestment scams: Scammers are offering online promotions on various platforms, including social media, claiming that the products or services of publicly traded companies can prevent, detect, or cure COVID-19, and that the stock of these companies will dramatically increase in value as a result. These promotions are often styled as \\\"research reports,\\\" make predictions of a specific \\\"target price,\\\" and relate to microcap stocks, or low-priced stocks issued by the smallest of companies with limited publicly available information.\\n\\nTips on Avoiding COVID-19 Scams\\n\\nThe New Jersey COVID-19 Fraud Task Force, a joint federal-state effort to investigate and prosecute unlawful and misleading activities related to COVID-19, has provided several recommendations to avoid common COVID-19 related scams:\\n\\nIndependently verify the identity of any company, charity, or individual that contacts you regarding COVID-19.\\nCheck the websites and email addresses offering information, products, or services related to COVID-19.

The Department of Health has issued a Directive with measures that must be in place to reduce risks, including:\\n\\nA resident who is suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 or quarantined for a COVID-19 exposure cannot have visitors. A resident who has tested positive is allowed visitation after they have met the criteria for discontinuation of isolation.\\nThere will only be two visitors permitted at a time and the visitors must remain at least 6 feet away from the resident. Both visitors and residents must wear face coverings.\\nA staff member, wearing a surgical mask, must remain with the resident during the visit.\\nA designated area should be established for visitors to be screened that maintains social distancing and infection control standards. If the individual has any COVID-19 symptoms, they will not be permitted to visit with a resident.\\nVisitors are not allowed beyond the reception area of the facilities and restrooms will not be available to them.\\nWhen staff are transporting the resident outdoors, they cannot be moved through any space where either positive or suspected COVID patients are cohorted. A safe distance of 6 feet distance must be maintained between other residents and staff.\\nLong-term care facilities should communicate the visitor policy to residents, families, staff and others. They should receive informed consent from the resident and the visitor in writing that they are aware of the possible dangers of COVID-19 exposure and that they will comply with the facility's policies during the visit. As part of the consent form, the visitor must agree to notify the facility if they test positive for the virus or have symptoms within 14 days of visiting.\\n\\nFor a full list of safety requirements, refer to the Department of Health Executive Directive 20-017.\\n\\nEnd-Of-Life Visitation\\n\\nDuring end-of-life situations, healthy visitors are permitted within long-term care facilities, assisted living residences, dementia care homes, pediatric transitional care homes, and comprehensive personal care homes.\\n\\nHealthy is defined as individuals with no signs of respiratory illness such as fever, cough or shortness of breath.

Manatt Health provided several recommendations to improve quality, safety, and resilience within New Jersey's long-term care system. New Jersey has implemented several key recommendations, including substantially clearing a backlog of more than 4,000 complaints, completing infection control focused surveys in 449 facilities, and setting up a central Long-Term Care Emergency Operations Center.\\n\\nIn addition, the State is working to support facilities during this health crisis. In April, State surveyors inspected 60 facilities to examine infection control procedures, staffing levels, the availability of PPE, and outbreak response plans -- which includes family notification.\\n\\nIn several instances, surveys resulted in the issuance of directed plans of correction and some facilities were directed to bring on consultants in nursing and infection control.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in response to the significant number of deaths and disturbing complaints about these facilities, on April 16, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office opened an investigation into the state's long-term care facilities.\\n\\nIf you have first-hand knowledge of illegal activity or other misconduct at a nursing home or a long-term care facility during the COVID-19 outbreak, please fill out this online reporting form (covid19.nj.gov/ltc) from the New Jersey Attorney General's Office.\"\n",

The majority of respondents (54%) will rely on state/local government and Department of Health guidelines\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00eegreater than those who will rely on Centers for Disease Control (23%) and industry and association guidelines (14%).\\n\\nCustomer-facing businesses report that limiting occupancy or reducing capacity of their facilities will be the most difficult challenge.\\n\\nOther findings from the survey include:\\n\\nA large majority of business and non-profit owners plan to change their business operations to achieve social distancing, including seven in 10 (70%) who indicate they will re-configure their workplace footprint.\\nSome businesses (35%) have expanded remote work options in response to the pandemic or are considering it in order to reduce the number of employees at work.\\nEight in 10 (79%) businesses in customer-facing industries will require employees to wear facemasks, whether or not the government requires them, and will also provide employees with facemasks to wear while in the workplace (79%).\\nSeven in 10 (72%) customer-facing businesses will require customers/visitors to wear facemasks, whether or not the government requires them, and four in 10 (40%) of businesses plan to provide them.\\nSeven in 10 (68%) are concerned with their ability to pay their rent, mortgage, or utilities. Another five in 10 say paying their employees (48%) and paying taxes (47%) are major challenges that their organizations are facing.\\n\\nThe roughly 4,000 responses from business and non-profit owners or decision makers, collected between May 21st and June 3rd, mirror the New Jersey business community in size and industry composition. Most respondents have less than 10 employees, and most have been in operation for at least 10 years. Half of respondents are from woman- or minority-owned businesses. The survey was conducted in both English and Spanish.\\n\\nRespondents are evenly distributed across North, Central, and South Jersey and businesses vary across New Jersey sectors. The survey included a non-probability, opt-in sample of respondents and was distributed via dozens of New Jersey industry groups, chambers of commerce, and non-profit organizations.\\n\\nFor the full survey results, please click here.\"\n",

Relief options offered by participating servicers include:\\n\\nProviding a minimum of 90 days of forbearance relief for borrowers;\\nWaiving late payment fees for borrowers;\\nEnsuring no borrower is subject to negative credit reporting;\\nCeasing debt collection lawsuits for 90 days; and\\nWorking with eligible borrowers to enroll them in other applicable borrower assistance programs.\\n\\nThis is an initiative that servicers have opted into.

This suspension of payments will last until Sept. 30, 2020, but you can still make payments if you choose.\\n\\nTo determine if your loans are eligible, contact your loan servicer online or by phone. Your servicer is the entity to which you make your monthly payment. If you do not know who your servicer is or how to contact them, visit StudentAid.gov/login or call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243; TTY for the deaf or hearing-impaired 1-800-730-8913) for assistance.\\n\\nFor more information, please refer to this frequently asked questions page from the United States Department of Education.\\n\\nFinancial Aid Programs\\n\\nNOTE: The deadline to apply for renewal of state tuition aid for the 2020-2021 academic year passed on June 1.\\n\\nNew legislation directs the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA) to exclude the Spring 2020 semester from a student's total lifetime eligibility limits for all state financial aid programs if a student is unable to finish the semester due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nAdditionally, students who withdrew or reduced credits during this time will not have to repay the state financial aid amounts that the student would have had to return under previous law.\\n\\nThe eligibility criteria for the New Jersey Student Tuition Assistance Reward Scholarship (NJ STARS) Program and the New Jersey Student Tuition Assistance Reward Scholarship II (NJ STARS II) Program will also be temporarily relaxed to allow students to remain eligible even if their Spring 2020 grade point average fell below the previous eligibility minimums.\\n\\nAs New Jersey students and families face the challenges of responding to the Coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy, is committed to helping borrowers with loans through the New Jersey College Loans to Assist State Students (NJCLASS) program.\\n\\nDue to the current crisis, NJCLASS borrowers may be experiencing unemployment, illness, or other changes that have reduced their earnings. HESAA offers several repayment relief options to borrowers in circumstances that have interrupted their ability to make payments on NJCLASS loans.\\n\\nThere is no fee to apply for any of the relief options, and HESAA has never charged borrowers late fees. During this public health emergency, HESAA has also suspended the use of wage garnishments and withholding of state income tax refunds to collect on past due loans.\\n\\nFor more information about HESAA's relief programs and how to apply, HESAA has created a reference guide.\\n\\nPrivate Student Loans\\n\\nThe State has secured relief options with private student loan servicers to expand on the protections the federal government granted to federal student loan borrowers. These new options stand to benefit an estimated 200,000 New Jerseyans with privately held student loans.\\n\\nNew Jersey residents with commercially-owned Federal Family Education Program Loans or privately held student loans who are struggling to make their payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic will be eligible for expanded relief.\\n\\nBorrowers in need of assistance must immediately contact their student loan servicer to identify the options that are appropriate to their circumstances. Relief options offered by participating servicers include:\\n\\nProviding a minimum of 90 days of forbearance relief for borrowers;\\nWaiving late payment fees for borrowers;\\nEnsuring no borrower is subject to negative credit reporting;\\nCeasing debt collection lawsuits for 90 days; and\\nWorking with eligible borrowers to enroll them in other applicable borrower assistance programs.\\n\\nThis is an initiative that servicers have opted into. Borrowers should contact their servicers to utilize the relief options.\\n\\nResidents who have questions or are experiencing trouble with their student loan servicer may contact the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance Consumer Hotline at 1-800-446-7467 or file a complaint online.\"\n",

For these districts, we are providing them with flexibility to rearrange their school schedules to allow for grouping -- or cohorting -- of students, or by implementing hybrid learning environments in which students receive both in-person and remote instruction.\\n\\nDistricts should share preliminary scheduling plans with staff, families, and students at least four weeks before the start of the school year in order to allow families to plan child care and work arrangements.\\n\\nBecause reopening is dependent upon health data and informed by experts in the health field, districts will need to be prepared to pivot to remote instruction at any time during the 2020-2021 school year.\\n\\nGuidance for Full-Time Remote Instruction\\n\\nThe Department of Education has issued additional guidance for parents who choose full-time remote learning for their children in the 2020-2021 school year.\\n\\nThe core elements of the guidance include:\\n\\nUniversal eligibility: All students, including students who receive special education or related services, are eligible for full-time remote learning if their parent or guardian chooses.\\nPolicies and procedures: School districts must set clear policies and procedures for families who want full-time remote learning for their children. School districts also need procedures for students in full-time remote learning to transition back to in-person services.\\nCommunications: School districts must communicate clearly and frequently with families, in their home language, about the availability of this offering and the related procedures.\\nQuality of programming: Students participating in all-remote instruction should receive the same quality of instruction that is provided to any other student. In addition, full-time remote programs must adhere to the same policies and regulations that in-person and hybrid programs follow regarding student attendance and the length of the school day.\\nData reporting: To help the Department evaluate fulltime remote learning, school districts will report data to the Department about student participation in these programs.\\n\\nThe full guidance is available on the Department of Education's \\\"Restart and Recovery: The Road Back\\\" webpage.\\n\\nClosing The Digital Divide\\n\\nTo address \\\"the digital divide\\\" and ensure reliable internet connectivity and access to one-to-one digital devices for every student, New Jersey is:\\n\\nOffering $10 million of the State's federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds to public school districts to purchase digital devices and internet connectivity for one-to-one student use \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec the Department of Education will release an application for districts;\\nRedirecting up to $44 million in Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) funds, with an additional $6 million available for nonpublic schools, to close any remaining gap and fill the unmet digital device and internet connectivity needs of New Jersey students.\\n\\n2020 SUMMER PROGRAMS\\n\\nAs of July 6, school districts may hold in-person summer educational programs including extended school year and special education services so long as they follow the health and safety protocols outlined by the NJ Department of Health for Youth summer camps. For more details on these requirements, refer to this article.\\n\\nSchool districts may decide the best way to meet their students' educational needs in a safe environment \\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec whether it be in-person, remote, or hybrid.\\n\\nIn addition, the Department of Education has released guidance that will allow districts to provide robust programs in a safe environment, while preparing students for the school year ahead.\\n\\nTo learn more, refer to the Department of Education's Summer Learning Resource Guide and Guidance on the Delivery of Extended School Year Services.\\n\\nThe Department of Education has also provided resources to help parents, students, educators, and administrators stay prepared, healthy, and safe: https://www.nj.gov/education/covid19/\"\n",

      "          \"context\": \"Expanding access to COVID-19 testing is a core principle of New Jersey's recovery plan for promoting public health and restoring economic health. New Jersey is:\\n\\nincreasing diagnostic testing capacity;\\nensuring testing for health care workers, essential personnel, and vulnerable populations;\\ncreating a flexible testing plan accessible to all residents;\\nexpanding partnerships with institutions of higher education, private-sector labs, and the federal government; and\\nensuring that those who test positive are linked to a health care provider.\\n\\nNew Jersey will double its testing capacity and increase to at least 20,000 tests per day by the end of May. This capacity will be built out moving forward with a minimum of 25,000 tests completed per day by the end of June.\\n\\nClick here for information on where and how to get tested in New Jersey.\\n\\nMaking Testing Available to All Residents\\n\\nTesting is available to everyone in New Jersey. Anyone who wants a COVID-19 diagnostic test can now get one at any of the 250 testing sites across New Jersey.\\n\\nTo help increase testing capacity, the State has authorized the more than 18,000 licensed pharmacists in New Jersey to administer FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 tests to their customers. The Department of Health has also issued a standing order allowing New Jersey residents to get tested for COVID-19 without a prescription.\\n\\nYou can now get tested for COVID-19 at many pharmacies across New Jersey as well as health care facilities and locations set up by counties and cities. To find a testing site near you, visit covid19.nj.gov/testing\\n\\nNote: Some testing sites require an appointment in advance. Please check with a testing site before going to see what their hours and requirements are.\\n\\nIncreasing Laboratory Processing Capacity\\n\\nDue to a surge in COVID-19 cases in other states that is causing backlogs in laboratories that process COVID-19 diagnostic tests across the nation, the State of New Jersey is working to increase laboratory capacity within the Garden State to ensure tests are rapidly processed.\\n\\nIn late July, the Department of Health issued a Request for Proposals to fund hospital laboratories to increase COVID-19 testing capacity and availability. These grant funds will also strengthen and upgrade the existing healthcare laboratory system resources for infectious disease testing.\\n\\nThe total funding for this initiative is $94 million. Applications for funding are due on August 9 and awards are expected to be announced in early September.\\n\\nTesting Vulnerable Populations, Health Care Workers, and Essential Personnel\\n\\nNew Jersey has ensured access to testing for vulnerable populations, including residents in long-term care facilities and developmental centers, individuals in the corrections system, those in homeless shelters, patients in psychiatric hospitals, and seasonal farmworkers. The State testing program will also ensure ready access for frontline health care workers, first responders, and transit workers.\\n\\nThe State developed a comprehensive testing plan for residents and staff at long-term care facilities. Baseline testing was completed for all residents and staff by the end of May and retesting continues for residents and staff who have tested negative. As of July 22, 232,000 tests have been completed on residents and 367,000 tests for staff.\\nThe Department of Corrections has completed universal baseline testing of staff, inmates, and residents at all Corrections Facilities, Residential Release Programs, and Assessment Centers.\\nAll residents in the State's Developmental Centers have been tested and all staff are expected to be tested soon.\\nUniversal baseline testing of all residents and staff has been completed at State Veterans Homes\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00ec Paramus, Menlo Park, and Vineland.\\nAs of June 5, universal testing of patients at State Psychiatric Hospitals has been completed and universal testing of staff is underway.\\nThe Departments of Health, Labor, and Agriculture, with Federally Qualified Health Centers, have developed a plan and are working with farms across the state to test seasonal farm workers.\\nNew Jersey will utilize mobile testing units to directly serve communities of color, the homeless, and underserved residents, and will open testing sites within institutions of faith, including churches, synagogues, and mosques.\\nAll NJ TRANSIT employees will also soon have access to COVID-19 testing at the American Dream site in East Rutherford, with plans to expand access to similar testing sites in Central and South Jersey.\\n\\nPartnering with Institutions of Higher Education, Private-Sector Labs, and the Federal Government\\n\\nNew Jersey is partnering with federal partners, private labs, and with universities.\\nRutgers University has developed a new saliva-based testing system. On May 7, the FDA approved the test for at-home saliva collection. The State is directing $6 million in federal funding to Rutgers to boost their test production capabilities from 10,000 tests per day to 50,000 per day.\\n\\nThe State is partnering with the private sector to increase the availability of COVID-19 testing in New Jersey. Testing for COVID-19 is being performed in the state by both LabCorp and BioReference Laboratories, enhancing access to testing for state residents.\\n\\nOn April 30, the State announced it would receive 550,000 new COVID-19 test kits and 750,000 swabs from the federal government.\\n\\nPreviously, the State announced the acquisition of 15 point-of-care Abbot ID NOW testing instruments from the federal government to expand access to COVID-19 testing in New Jersey. The portable, rapid testing machines will be dispersed to health care systems throughout the state and are able to test for COVID-19 and process specimens in approximately 5-13 minutes.\"\n",

This, for example, would include truckers driving from an impacted state to New Jersey, and any state, local and federal officials and employees traveling in their official capacities on government business.\\n\\nIndividuals traveling for business should still consider postponing travel to the extent possible. Individuals are encouraged to self-monitor for symptoms upon return from any travel to an impacted state, and employers should consider screening employees for symptoms before permitting them to return to work. Employees and employers should follow current CDC guidance regarding travel, available here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html\\n\\nCritical Infrastructure Workers\\nExceptions to the travel advisory are also permitted for individuals traveling to New Jersey from designated states who work in critical infrastructure, as defined by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The comprehensive list of critical infrastructure industries is available here: https://www.cisa.gov/identifying-critical-infrastructure-during-covid-19.\\n\\nCritical Infrastructure workers who have had an exposure but remain asymptomatic should adhere to the screening, social distancing, and mitigation practices prior to and during their work shift, as outlined by the CDC.\\n\\nConsult with your employer regarding whether there is industry-specific guidance that may apply to you (e.g. guidance for health care professionals: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html ). Please consult the DOH website and resources for additional details and information regarding isolation procedures for when a person under quarantine is diagnosed with COVID-19 or develops symptoms.\\n\\nSeasonal Migrant Farm Workers\\nMigrant workers can continue to work with precautions. Critical infrastructure workers and employers should follow guidance from CDC, as well as NJ Department of Health, regarding strategies to limit disease spread.\\n\\nTesting\\n\\nTesting is available to everyone in New Jersey and is strongly encouraged for those who travelled to areas heavily impacted by COVID-19. To find a testing site near you, visit covid19.nj.gov/testing\\n\\nIf you are from an impacted state and get a diagnostic/virus test, you should still self-quarantine for 14 days. If you test negative, you are still advised to self-quarantine for 14 days because you remain in the incubation period. A diagnostic test is a point-in-time indicator from the date of when you were last exposed - in this case, being in a state with significant community spread of COVID-19.\\n\\nIf you are positive, you should self-isolate for 10 days and at least three days (or 72 hours) after any fever is resolved and any other symptoms are significantly improved. You should only leave self-isolation to receive medical care and to obtain food or other essential items.\\n\\nAdditional Travel Guidance\\n\\nDomestic Travel\\n\\nThe CDC advises not to travel if you are sick, or if you have been around someone with COVID-19 in the past 14 days. Do not travel with someone who is sick.\\n\\nIf you're thinking about travelling, consult the CDC's guide to assess your risk and other considerations.\\n\\nFor up-to-date information and travel guidance, check the state or local health department where you are, along your route, and at your planned destination.\\n\\nWhile you are traveling, it is possible a state or local government may put into place travel restrictions, such as stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, mandated quarantines upon arrival, or even state border closures. Plan to keep checking for updates as you travel.\\n\\nInternational Travel\\n\\nThe CDC recommends avoiding all non-essential international travel due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nIf you travelled internationally in the last 14 days, the CDC recommends you stay home, monitor your health, and practice social distancing for 14 days after you return from travel.\\n\\nLearn more about what to do if you are sick after travel.\"\n",

This includes travel by train, bus, car, plane and any other method of transportation.\\n\\nThe 14-day quarantine travel advisory applies to travel from certain states identified as those that have a positive COVID-19 test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents or have a 10% or higher positivity rate over a seven-day rolling average (\\\"impacted states.\\\")\\n\\nAs of Tuesday, July 28, there are currently 36 states that meet the criteria stated above:\\n\\nAlabama (added 6/24/20)\\nAlaska (added 7/21/20)\\nArkansas (added 6/24/20)\\nArizona (added 6/24/20)\\nCalifornia (added 6/30/20)\\nDelaware (re-added 7/21/20)\\nDistrict of Columbia (added 7/28/20)\\nFlorida (added 6/24/20)\\nGeorgia (added 6/30/20)\\nIowa (added 6/30/20)\\nIdaho (added 6/30/20)\\nIllinois (added 7/28/20)\\nIndiana (added 7/21/20)\\nKansas (added 7/7/20)\\nKentucky (added 7/28/20)\\nLouisiana (added 6/30/20)\\nMaryland (added 7/21/20)\\nMinnesota (re-added 7/28/20)\\nMississippi (added 6/30/20)\\nMissouri (added 7/21/20)\\nMontana (added 7/21/20)\\nNebraska (added 7/21/20)\\nNevada (added 6/30/20)\\nNew Mexico (added 7/14/20)\\nNorth Carolina (added 6/24/20)\\nNorth Dakota (added 7/21/20)\\nOhio (added 7/14/20)\\nOklahoma (added 7/7/20)\\nPuerto Rico (added 7/28/20)\\nSouth Carolina (added 6/24/20)\\nTennessee (added 6/30/20)\\nTexas (added 6/24/20)\\nUtah (added 6/24/20)\\nVirginia (added 7/21/20)\\nWashington (added 7/21/20)\\nWisconsin (added 7/14/20)\\n\\nThis list will be updated regularly.\\n\\nThe self-quarantine is voluntary, but compliance is expected.\\n\\nWe ask that you complete a voluntary online survey to provide information about where you are traveling from and your destination if you have traveled to, or are returning from, one of the states that has been designated above.\\n\\nIf you choose to provide this information, it will be shared with local New Jersey Public Health authorities and other third parties when required by law. Local health departments will contact you to remind you to self-quarantine and offer assistance including information about testing locations.\\n\\nAccess the survey by visiting covid19.nj.gov/njtravel or texting \\\"NJTRAVEL\\\" to 898211.\\n\\nPlease note that this advisory does not apply to individuals:\\n\\nWho passed through a designated state for a period of limited duration (i.e. less than 24 hours) through the course of travel.\\nWho are passing through New Jersey on a layover for a period of limited duration (i.e. less than 24 hours) through the course of travel.\\nWho are traveling to New Jersey for business matters that are exempted from the application of the travel advisory.\\nWho are traveling to New Jersey and work in critical infrastructure fields, such as health care and federal, state and local law enforcement. Consult with your employer regarding whether there is industry-specific guidance that may apply to you.\\n\\nTravelers and residents returning from impacted states should self-quarantine at their home, a hotel, or other temporary lodging. Individuals should only leave the place of self-quarantine to seek medical care/treatment or to obtain food and other essential items. As one example, no one who has traveled to or from a state on the COVID-19 hotspot list should be participating in or attending an in-person graduation ceremony.\\n\\nFor answers to commonly asked questions, refer to the Department of Health's Frequently Asked Questions about the self-quarantine for travelers.\\n\\nExemptions\\n\\nBusiness Travel\\nIndividuals who are traveling to New Jersey from impacted states for business are exempted from the application of the travel advisory. This, for example, would include truckers driving from an impacted state to New Jersey, and any state, local and federal officials and employees traveling in their official capacities on government business.\\n\\nIndividuals traveling for business should still consider postponing travel to the extent possible. Individuals are encouraged to self-monitor for symptoms upon return from any travel to an impacted state, and employers should consider screening employees for symptoms before permitting them to return to work. Employees and employers should follow current CDC guidance regarding travel, available here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html\\n\\nCritical Infrastructure Workers\\nExceptions to the travel advisory are also permitted for individuals traveling to New Jersey from designated states who work in critical infrastructure, as defined by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. This would include, for example, health care workers and state and local law enforcement. The comprehensive list of critical infrastructure industries is available here: https://www.cisa.gov/identifying-critical-infrastructure-during-covid-19.\\n\\nCritical Infrastructure workers who have had an exposure but remain asymptomatic should adhere to the screening, social distancing, and mitigation practices prior to and during their work shift, as outlined by the CDC.\\n\\nConsult with your employer regarding whether there is industry-specific guidance that may apply to you (e.g. guidance for health care professionals: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html ). Please consult the DOH website and resources for additional details and information regarding isolation procedures for when a person under quarantine is diagnosed with COVID-19 or develops symptoms.\\n\\nSeasonal Migrant Farm Workers\\nMigrant workers can continue to work with precautions. Critical infrastructure workers and employers should follow guidance from CDC, as well as NJ Department of Health, regarding strategies to limit disease spread.\\n\\nTesting\\n\\nTesting is available to everyone in New Jersey and is strongly encouraged for those who travelled to areas heavily impacted by COVID-19. To find a testing site near you, visit covid19.nj.gov/testing\\n\\nIf you are from an impacted state and get a diagnostic/virus test, you should still self-quarantine for 14 days. If you test negative, you are still advised to self-quarantine for 14 days because you remain in the incubation period. A diagnostic test is a point-in-time indicator from the date of when you were last exposed - in this case, being in a state with significant community spread of COVID-19.\\n\\nIf you are positive, you should self-isolate for 10 days and at least three days (or 72 hours) after any fever is resolved and any other symptoms are significantly improved. You should only leave self-isolation to receive medical care and to obtain food or other essential items.\\n\\nAdditional Travel Guidance\\n\\nDomestic Travel\\n\\nThe CDC advises not to travel if you are sick, or if you have been around someone with COVID-19 in the past 14 days. Do not travel with someone who is sick.\\n\\nIf you're thinking about travelling, consult the CDC's guide to assess your risk and other considerations.\\n\\nFor up-to-date information and travel guidance, check the state or local health department where you are, along your route, and at your planned destination.\\n\\nWhile you are traveling, it is possible a state or local government may put into place travel restrictions, such as stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, mandated quarantines upon arrival, or even state border closures. Plan to keep checking for updates as you travel.\\n\\nInternational Travel\\n\\nThe CDC recommends avoiding all non-essential international travel due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nIf you travelled internationally in the last 14 days, the CDC recommends you stay home, monitor your health, and practice social distancing for 14 days after you return from travel.\\n\\nLearn more about what to do if you are sick after travel.\"\n",
